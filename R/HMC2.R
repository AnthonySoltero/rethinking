# SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATION OF HAMILTONIAN MONTE CARLO.
# 
# Modified slightly based on code by 
# Radford M. Neal, 2010.
#
# This original appears in Figure 2 of "MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics",
# the Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
#
# The arguments to the HMC function are as follows:
#
#   U          A function to evaluate minus the log of the density of the
#              distribution to be sampled, plus any constant - ie, the
#              "potential energy".
#
#   grad_U     A function to evaluate the gradient of U.
#
#   epsilon    The stepsize to use for the leapfrog steps.
#
#   L          The number of leapfrog steps to do to propose a new state.
#
#   current_q  The current state (position variables only).
#
# Momentum variables are sampled from independent standard normal
# distributions within this function.  The value return is the vector
# of new position variables (equal to current_q if the endpoint of the
# trajectory was rejected).

# this modified version returns trajectories for q,p
# ... for arguments to pass to U and grad_U
# returns H for monitoring divergences
HMC2 <- function (U, grad_U, epsilon, L, current_q , ... ) {
  q = current_q
  p = rnorm(length(q),0,1)  # independent standard normal variates
  current_p = p
  # Make a half step for momentum at the beginning
  p = p - epsilon * grad_U( q , ... ) / 2
  # Alternate full steps for position and momentum
  qtraj <- matrix(NA,nrow=L+1,ncol=length(q))
  ptraj <- qtraj
  qtraj[1,] <- current_q
  ptraj[1,] <- p
  for (i in 1:L)
  {
    # Make a full step for the position
    q = q + epsilon * p
    # Make a full step for the momentum, except at end of trajectory
    if (i!=L) {
        p = p - epsilon * grad_U(q,...)
        ptraj[i+1,] <- p
    }
    qtraj[i+1,] <- q
  }
  # Make a half step for momentum at the end.
  p = p - epsilon * grad_U(q,...) / 2
  ptraj[L+1,] <- p
  # Negate momentum at end of trajectory to make the proposal symmetric
  p = -p
  # Evaluate potential and kinetic energies at start and end of trajectory
  current_U = U(current_q,...)
  current_K = sum(current_p^2) / 2
  proposed_U = U(q,...)
  proposed_K = sum(p^2) / 2
  H0 <- current_U + current_K
  H1 <- proposed_U + proposed_K
  # Accept or reject the state at end of trajectory, returning either
  # the position at the end of the trajectory or the initial position
  new_q <- q
  accept <- 0
  if (runif(1) < exp(current_U-proposed_U+current_K-proposed_K)) {
    new_q <- q  # accept
    accept <- 1
  } else
    new_q <- current_q  # reject

  return(
    list(
        q = new_q,
        traj = qtraj,
        ptraj = ptraj,
        accept = accept , 
        dH = H1 - H0 ) )
}
